**Observation management for the Discovery Dish station — plan, run, and record attended radio
observations end to end.**

Station software for a hydrogen-line telescope: KrakenRF Discovery Dish 700 mm + H-line feed
(1420 MHz) → Airspy Mini → Raspberry Pi 5, in Manayunk, Philadelphia. Two tiers: a Python server
side (a FastAPI API server plus a separate SDR-owning capture daemon, so a USB hiccup never takes
down the observation record) and a thin browser UI that works from any laptop or tablet on the
LAN. Sibling of the [`jansky`](https://github.com/joebarbere/jansky) course (whose tested library
this reuses) and [`jansky-research`](https://github.com/joebarbere/jansky-research).

## Status

**Feature-complete (M0–M9 all shipped):** capture (synthetic + real Airspy), observation
records + session wizard + observing ladder, the `hline_v1` classifier with live HI badge and
LSR axes, a live total-power strip, PDF reports + photos + Virgo/ezRA exporters, Stellarium cross-check, HackRF RFI
sweep, gpsd locations, the **`v0.7.0` station cockpit** (status bar, diagnostics MCP,
archive/soft-delete, dark mode + localization, spectrum audio, `--fps` knob, RFI-survey
template), the **`v0.8.0` calibration & scheduling** milestone (calibration epochs, an
offline sky chart, drift-scan campaigns with sidereal-day stacking, and an unattended
transit scheduler), the **`v0.9.0` research bridge & guides** milestone (a stable station
UUID, the codified JSON+npz observation bundle plan 78 consumes, and printable build +
observation guide PDFs), and the **`v0.10.0` rotator** milestone (az/el control of the KrakenRF
Discovery Drive over rotctl-TCP + EasyComm II, drift tracking, and a guarded `slew_rotator` MCP
verb) over a 22-tool MCP surface, and the **`v0.11.x` M10** milestone (ON/OFF
position-switching captures, an ON−OFF difference classifier, and a sky/ground ΔdB/Tsys
Y-factor reduction). **`v1.0.0` is not a feature** — it is tagged
after one real end-to-end observing campaign (plan → observe → confirm → PDF). See
`CHANGES.md` for the full version history and `plans/roadmap-post-v0.6.md` for what comes
after.

The post-v0.6 milestones are specified in `plans/roadmap-post-v0.6.md` — they build while
waiting for first light and none of them move the `v1.0.0` gate.

## Quickstart (dev)

Requires the `jansky` repo checked out next to this one (`../jansky`).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/joebarbere/jansky-observe.git   # next to ../jansky
cd jansky-observe
make setup          # uv sync — pinned Python 3.12 env

# Two terminals:
make daemon         # capture daemon, synthetic noise + fake-HI source
make run            # API server at http://localhost:8000

# Open http://localhost:8000 — live waterfall from the synthetic source.
```

`make help` lists the rest (`test`, `cov`, `lint`, `typecheck`, `qemu-install`, …).

### Recording

Captures come in two formats: **`.npz`** (Welch spectra — compact, the default for watching the
line) and **SigMF** (raw IQ — **~43 GB/hour at 3 MSPS**, so mind the live disk-usage readout).
Files land in `data/captures/` in dev and `/var/lib/jansky-observe/captures/` on the Pi. To
switch the Pi between the synthetic source and the real Airspy (first light!):

```bash
curl -fsSL https://github.com/joebarbere/jansky-observe/releases/latest/download/install.sh \
  | sudo bash -s -- --set-source airspy      # or: synthetic
```

(it edits `/etc/default/jansky-observe` and restarts only the capture daemon; the API
server and its records stay up).

### Observing

Sessions run through the **session wizard** (linked from the home page at
`http://raspberrypi.local:8000`): pick a target from the seeded source list, get az/el,
transit time, drift rate, and the weather snapshot, then work the type's checklist — every
tick is persisted with who and when. The seeded observation types form the **observing
ladder**, and it starts with **Sun pointing calibration**: it measures the Δaz/Δel offsets
the server applies to every future pointing display, so do it before anything pointed.

Claude can plan and troubleshoot at the dish too — the server exposes a read-mostly MCP
surface (no bias-tee control, no deletes, by design):

```bash
claude mcp add --transport http jansky-observe http://raspberrypi.local:8000/mcp
```

then `/plan-session` recommends tonight's target and pre-fills a draft observation in the
wizard.

### Confirmation

"Am I actually seeing hydrogen?" gets a code answer, not a vibe. While observing, the live
view carries an **HI badge** — a running SNR computed on the server's accumulating average
spectrum. After the session, the deterministic classifier runs over any `.npz` capture
(`run_classifier` via MCP, or `POST /api/captures/{id}/classify`): baseline fit, peak search
inside the LSR-corrected Doppler window, verdict from SNR (`detected` ≥ 5, `uncertain` 2–5).
Verdicts are stored as `ClassifierResult` rows (classifier name + version) with plots, and
every spectrum is served on either axis (`?axis=mhz|vlsr`). `/analyze-observation` turns the
results into an honest analysis note — verdicts come from code, Claude interprets. The HI4PI
sky cross-check (v2) follows via `jansky-research`.

### Reports & export

Sessions end as documents, not just files. Attach photos to an observation (drag-drop,
resized on ingest) and pick one as the **highlight**; then one click — or `/write-up` via
Claude — builds the **PDF report**: header and highlight photo, metadata, weather, the
checklist as performed, the v_LSR profile and waterfall, classifier verdicts, notes, and the
capture inventory. For the amateur-HI ecosystem, any capture's averaged spectrum exports as
**Virgo-style CSV** or **ezRA `.txt`** (`GET /api/captures/{id}/export?format=...`) — one-way
conveniences; SigMF and `.npz` stay the internal formats.

## Install on the Pi

One prerequisite: a Raspberry Pi 5 running the pinned **Raspberry Pi OS Lite (64-bit) "Trixie"**
image (exact image in [`deploy/OS_IMAGE`](deploy/OS_IMAGE)), flashed with SSH enabled. Everything
else is the install script's job:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://github.com/joebarbere/jansky-observe/releases/latest/download/install.sh | sudo bash
```

Idempotent and re-runnable (re-running upgrades in place); installs apt deps, uv, the release
wheel, udev rules, and the two systemd units, then health-checks itself. Flags: `--version vX.Y.Z`,
`--no-start`, `--uninstall`, `--reset-data`.

### Resetting station data (QA / clean install)

Practice sessions while you learn the software don't have to live in your station log forever.
Everything the station records — the SQLite database, captures, photos, reports — lives in one
directory (`data/` in dev, `/var/lib/jansky-observe/` on the Pi), and the reset is all-or-nothing:

```bash
rm -rf data/            # dev — or point JANSKY_OBSERVE_DATA_DIR at a scratch dir instead

sudo bash install.sh --reset-data       # Pi — stops the services, wipes the data dir, restarts
                                        # (add --yes when piping through curl | bash)
```

Migrations and seeds rebuild a fresh, empty station on the next start. There is deliberately no
per-observation delete: an observing log you can edit selectively isn't a log, and the MCP
surface carries no delete verbs at all (plan §12.4). M6 adds a restorable **archive** for
hiding observations without destroying provenance — the reset stays the only destructive verb.

## Plan

The full project plan — architecture, data model, integrations, milestones — lives in
[`plans/jansky_observe.md`](plans/jansky_observe.md).

## Siblings

- [`jansky`](https://github.com/joebarbere/jansky) — the radio-astronomy course; this repo
  depends on its library (`jansky.signals`, `jansky.formats`, …).
- [`jansky-research`](https://github.com/joebarbere/jansky-research) — the research repo; once
  the station produces calibrated spectra, self-collected data feeds its slices.

## Support the station buildout

If this project is useful to you — or just fun to watch — you can help fund the next piece
of station hardware via [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/joebarbere) or
[Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/joebarbere). The current wishlist, roughly in order: storage for
IQ recordings → rooftop networking (PoE switch + access point) → Discovery Drive rotator →
a second dish → a KrakenSDR for coherent interferometry. Honestly: the wishlist is a general
direction, not a promise — the roadmap and the observing plans can and will change as the
station meets the real sky, and support also goes to smaller things like test equipment and
the coffee behind the long coding sessions.
